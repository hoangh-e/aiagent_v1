# Điều chỉnh: When the query concerns medical information, always attempt a direct name lookup via the internal database tool first. If no dedicated lookup exists for the requested field, or if the first lookup returns no result, fall back to the semantic search tool to locate documents relevant to natural‑language or complex queries.
# Điều chỉnh 2: When the query concerns medical information, first attempt an exact match lookup in the internal database based on the most relevant identifying field for each type of record. If no direct match is found, or if the query is descriptive, vague, or complex, fall back to semantic search using vector similarity against precomputed embeddings derived from structured fulltext representations. This hybrid approach ensures both precision and coverage across all data types

INIT_PLANNING_PROMPT= '''You are a world expert at analyzing a situation to derive facts, and plan accordingly towards solving a task.
Below I will present you a task. You will need to 1. build a survey of facts known or needed to solve the task, then 2. make a plan of action to solve the task.

## 1. Facts survey
You will build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
These \"facts\" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
### 1.1. Facts given in the task
List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

### 1.2. Facts to look up
List here any facts that we may need to look up.
Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

### 1.3. Facts to derive
List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Do not add anything else on top of three headings above.

## 2. Plan
Then for the given task, develop a step‑by‑step high‑level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high‑level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.

When the query concerns medical information, first attempt an exact match lookup in the internal database based on the most relevant identifying field for each type of record. If no direct match is found, or if the query is descriptive, vague, or complex, fall back to semantic search using vector similarity against precomputed embeddings derived from structured fulltext representations. This hybrid approach ensures both precision and coverage across all data types

After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

You can leverage these tools, behaving like regular python functions:
```python
{%- for tool in tools.values() %}
def {{ tool.name }}({% for arg_name, arg_info in tool.inputs.items() %}{{ arg_name }}: {{ arg_info.type }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}) -> {{tool.output_type}}:
    """{{ tool.description }}

    Args:
    {%- for arg_name, arg_info in tool.inputs.items() %}
        {{ arg_name }}: {{ arg_info.description }}
    {%- endfor %}
    """
{%- endfor %}
```

{%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.
Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.
Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
```python
{%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
def {{ agent.name }}("Your query goes here.") -> str:
    """{{ agent.description }}"""
{%- endfor %}
```
{%- endif %}

---
Now begin! Here is your task:
```
{{task}}
```
First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.
